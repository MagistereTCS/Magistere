<p><strong>Multimedia profiles</strong></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Select the multimedia profile to be used during the activity for multimedia exchanges (webcam, microphone and 
        multimedia documents). This option can have a significant impact on the fluidity of the exchanges and the necessary 
        bandwidth for each participant. Usually, for a better  experience or if you are not sure, it is better to use the 
        lower quality to  ensure exchange fluidity.
